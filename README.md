CDM economy will strengthen the CDM movement, and sustain this over a longer period.

What is CDM Economy? It is like black market economy but the opposite.

In a black market economy, you have the public price (cheaper) and the black market price (more expensive.)

In CDM economy, you have the more expensive price for the oppressors, and the CDM discount for CDM participants and weak people.
